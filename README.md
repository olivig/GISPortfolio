# GIS Portfolio

Welcome to my GIS portfolio repository! üåç‚ú®

My name is Oli Viglundsson and I am a GIS enthusiast!

I came across GIS when I studied for my bachelor in human geography with a focus on urban and rural planning a few years ago. When I finished my bachelors program in 2021 all I wanted to do was to start working with planning but the post-pandemic situation was tough and I had to review what I really found most interesting when it came down to my years of studies. The answer was Geographic Information Systems. Working with GIS was something that in terms of interest, really stood out during my university studies.
So after spending parental leave with my second child 2022 I began studying to become a GIS coordinator in the beginning 2023.

So as I journey through the fascinating world of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), I'm documenting my mapping adventures right here. Whether I'm plotting the best coffee spots in town ‚òï, analyzing urban sprawl üèôÔ∏è, or tracing the migratory paths of majestic birds ü¶Ö, you'll find my cartographic creations evolving with each step of my GIS coordinator studies.
