<div class="project-details-content">
  <div class="project-details-content">
    <div class="body-text">The thesis investigates how Gothenburg addresses climate-related heat challenges, focusing on urban heat islands through the use of GIS and satellite data analysis. By analyzing land surface temperatures using satellite data and Google Earth Engine, particularly vulnerable areas in the city were identified, mainly the central and densely built-up areas with low vegetation, where surface temperatures can exceed +40°C during the summer months. The study also reveals that areas with more vegetation and water bodies have lower temperatures, highlighting the importance of green and blue infrastructure to mitigate the effects of urban heat islands.
    </div>
    <div class="body-text">Gothenburg has implemented strategies to address these challenges, including the expansion of parks, tree planting, and water areas, in line with the city's environmental and climate program as well as the climate adaptation plan for 2024–2026. The results of the GIS analysis confirm that these strategies are effective in reducing temperatures in the urban environment. GIS plays a central role in monitoring heat phenomena and providing decision-makers with the tools to take appropriate action. A remaining challenge is to communicate the results clearly and accessibly to both the public and decision-makers, which is crucial for integrating the analyses into urban planning.</div>

  <div class="body-text">To classify and gain an overview of the land surfaces contributing to temperature changes, the National Land Cover Data from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has been utilized. Building polygons are sourced from the base map of Gothenburg city and are classified as impervious surfaces, primarily for visualization purposes. The study partly follows the methodology and practical application described in the Swedish Public Health Agency's report, <i>Kartläggning av bebyggelse med risk för höga temperaturer</i>

    The land cover data has been vectorized to calculate the proportion of different surface types.
