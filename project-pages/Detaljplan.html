          <div class="body-text">This project involved two old detailed development plans from 1975 and 1977 from Styrsö, the main island in the Gothenburg archipelago. The workflow involved aligning them with modern geographical data through georeferencing, and digitizing its features to create usable GIS layers. This process allows for better analysis, planning, and visualization of historical and current land use and planning regulations in the area.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The government has decided that information in new detailed development plans must be made accessible and processed digitally starting January 1, 2022. From this date, all new detailed development plans must be created according to the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning's (Boverket) regulations (2020:5) on detailed plans.</div>

                <div class="body-text">This was a fun excercise, the build up into creating and digitizing these maps involved alot of theory about urban planning and rural planning in Sweden, how to approach and plan for the use of land and water based on laws and regulations. To compare the differences in both quality of aerial images and how the area was supposed to be developed was so interesting. This is something im eager to learn more about and would absolutely want to work with in the future. </div>
