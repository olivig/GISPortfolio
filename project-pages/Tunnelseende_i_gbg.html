          <div class="body-text">In the 1960s, there were plans to build a city rail line / express tramway in tunnels under central Gothenburg. The plans are presented in the Express Tramway Investigation from 1967. The investigation includes, among other things, geological surveys and conditions for this project, as well as maps with planned route lines and stations.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Drawing inspiration from the Express Tramway Investigation and the tunnel routes proposed in the investigation, there was a curious need to review a suitable analysis tool that could support or find alternative solutions to these routes. The starting points are the station locations proposed in the investigation. The analysis has been done from station to station using a "Cost Path Analysis" based on a number of parameters such as: 'depth of soil', 'soil type', 'road network', and 'buildings'.</div>

The type of tunnel/track is visualized with each having a distinct color: rock tunnel in blue, soil tunnel in red, existing express tramway in green, and open track in yellow. The purpose of the color scheme is to more clearly differentiate the various tunnel and track sections that the original map from 1967 has been divided into.</span>
