Multispec, is a software application used for analyzing multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data. It provides a range of tools and functionalities for processing, analyzing, and visualizing imagery captured by satellite sensors, airborne sensors, and other remote sensing platforms.</div>
          <div class="body-text">All satellite captures that were used in these excercises are multispectral imagery provided by USGS (United States Geological Survey).</div>
