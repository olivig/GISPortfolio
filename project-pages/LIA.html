          <div class="body-text">During the fall of 2023 we had to reach out to organisations that worked with GIS in order to find ourselves an internship spot for 10 weeks! I got in touch with Felipe Verdú, group leader (and a GIS Guru!) at GIS & Remote Analysis at Norconsult AB, we discussed a bit about my previous academic background as a human geographer and what Ive already learned during the spring semester at Ocellus as well as what I wanted to delve into and learn more about. I mentioned that I was interested in learning more about QGIS and that I understood that FME was a useful program that is used quite a bit in the workplaces that work with GIS. </div>
          <div class="body-text">Since they use PostgreSQL databases on GIS & Remote Sensing and needed to populate metadata to the datasets they have in their main geodatabase, he suggested I look into a plug-in for QGIS called PgMetadata and that I could get back to him if it was interesting to me. 
            Working on popularizing and collecting metadata didn't sound like a fun map visualization project I had initially imagined, but what I was able to read was that this is an important work that many organizations working in both the public and private sectors have a great need for. I got in touch again and accepted the internship position.</div>
